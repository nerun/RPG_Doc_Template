# System Reference Document Template For RPG's

This work is based on the [DOCSIFY][1] magical site generator project.

This is a work in progress and is being updated.

## Why this project and who am I?

I am known on the web as **Nerun**. I discovered Coweater’s [RPG SRD Template](https://github.com/7thExtinctionrpg/RPG_SRD_Template) in 2024 when I intended to create markdown documentation for an RPG SRD, and I was captivated by it. I also had no idea what Docsify was and was even more amazed. So, many thanks to Coweater!

But nothing is perfect — the project needed some updates, so I created this fork.
