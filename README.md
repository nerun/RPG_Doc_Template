# System Reference Document Template For RPG's

This work is based on the [DOCSIFY][1] magical site generator project.

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress and is being updated.

## Why this project and who am I?

G'day, I'm known as Coweater and I'm the lead designer for an indie RPG [7th Extinction](https://7thExtinctionrpg.com). I needed something simple to create and host my SRD and after searching the web and a lot of trial & error I settled on Docsify, thanks Gulluth for your previous work. Knowing that not everyone is technically minded I wanted to do more than point indie developers to Docsify and say 'use this'.

So the plan is to continue to tweak and develop this, ensuring to keep it a simple project that any indie rpg can use to create great looking SRD online with zero cost and little technical knowledge.
